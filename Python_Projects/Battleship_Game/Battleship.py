        1. Objective: The goal of Battleship is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
        
        2. Each player places a set number of ships on their grid without showing their opponent. Ships vary 
           in size and occupy a set number of consecutive spaces either horizontally or vertically.

        3. Players take turns guessing coordinates on the opponent's grid to find and sink their ships. 
           Each turn, a player announces a target coordinate (e.g., "B4").

        4. If the target coordinate is occupied by an opponent's ship, it's a "hit." Otherwise, itâ€™s a "miss." 
           Mark hits and misses on your own grid for reference.

        5. When all cells of a particular ship are hit, that ship is considered "sunk."

        6. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins.
