# Mixed Messages

This is a simple JavaScript program that generates random messages by combining different setups and finishers. It can create either fortune readings or jokes, or a mix of both.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory.
3. Run the JavaScript file `MixedMessages.js`.
   ```bash
   node MixedMessages.js
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to choose the type of message you want to generate.
5. View the randomly generated message in the console.

## How It Works

The program uses arrays of setups and finishers for both fortune readings and jokes. It randomly selects one setup and one finisher from the respective arrays and combines them to create a message.

### Example Output

- Random fortune reading:
  ```
  You will achieve greatness
  ```
- Another random fortune reading:
  ```
  You may find love
  ```
- Random joke:
  ```
  Why did the chicken cross the road? To save the world!
  ```

## Customization

You can customize the sets of fortune setups, fortune finishers, joke setups, and joke finishers by modifying the arrays in the JavaScript file.
